# Download with (almost) not pain your fav' Telegram sticker pack
This is rather a crappy script to download from the browser your telegram sticker pack into webp files.
("tested" on Firefox & Chrome)

## Steps 1
- Access to your telegram account on your browser

## Steps 2
- Open the desired sticker pack (Settings > General Settings > Stickers)

- This should open a modal with all the sticker of the pack

## Steps 3
- Open your browser console (ask google if you don't know how)
- Paste the content of `function.py` file into the console
- Press enter and enjoy
